# love-coding

The main purpose of love-coding project is to share the solutions mostly writen in python 3.0 to coding problems. Apart from the project, I'm also writing some blogs on [zhangmapler](https://blog.zhangmapler.top) to explain the solutions in detail. 

You can just pull it to your local env and run the solutions.
